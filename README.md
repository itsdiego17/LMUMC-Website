========================================================
(LMUMC) Lambuth Memorial United Methodist Church READ ME
========================================================

My pastor asked me if I knew anything about computers because they needed someone that could help out with the churchs' website, and someone that could manage the presentations and videos played during the service. As soon as the project was mentioned, I had a discussion with my pastor about making their website better and keep it up to date. He agreed with it.
I have made a better website and I have showed it to the pastor and he loves it. He thinks that this site could make the church even better.

Entire Website:
-The logo was created with a program called inkscaped, which is similar to Adobe Illustrator CC6, I used the symbol from the church and since the name of the church is really long I had to abbreviate it. I made the cross part of the L and use the rest of the initial as letter. The background color of the logo is yellow because according to my pastor yellow can symbolize peace for some people.
-I used the cross for the favicon.
-The colors I used are the colors my pastor wanted me to use. I had to tweak them a little bit to get better contrast.
-The font I used it's the normal one because since people from different ages are going to visit this site it makes it easier on them to read.
-The slideshow shows pictures from the church, past events, and upcoming events.
-The navigation footer it's another way to go to pages without scrolling all the way up.
-Feel free to go through all of the website, maybe this can get you to come to Lambuth Memorial United Methodist Church.
