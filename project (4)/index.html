			<p>Lambuth Memorial is proud to call the LANA neighborhood home. LANA (the Lambuth Area Neighborhood Association) is the oldest and most active community association in the city of Jackson. Lambuth Memorial is multi-racial, multi-cultural, and works hard to keep our area a real community. Lambuth Memorial has been in ministry in this neighborhood for over 140 years. The congregation renewed our mission over twenty years ago with the building of our Family Life Center. At one time, most of our members lived within walking distance of the church. Now members drive from all over the city and county to worship and participate in educational and fellowship opportunities along with our neighborhood</p>

		<div class="grid-4">
			<h2>We combine both traditional and contemporary in our worship services.</h2>
			<p>We believe you will find a gracious, warm, and receptive community of faith. Our members are disciples who are committed to living and sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ.</p>
